    "   - `.values`: This converts the selected DataFrame into a NumPy array, which is required by many machine learning libraries for numerical operations.\n",

    "     - During this step, the model learns the relationship between the features and the target by finding the best-fitting line.

    "1. **Calculate Mean Squared Error and R-squared**\n",
    "   - `mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)`\n",
    "     - **`mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)`** calculates the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** between the actual target values (`y_test`) and the predicted values (`y_pred`).\n",
    "     - MSE measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values. It is used to understand how far the model's predictions are from the actual values.\n",
    "     - A **lower MSE** indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the actual values, while a **higher MSE** suggests a larger error.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)`\n",
    "     - **`r2_score(y_test, y_pred)`** calculates the **R-squared (R²)** value, which represents the proportion of the variance in the target variable (`y_test`) that is explained by the features (`X_test`).\n",
    "     - R² ranges from **0 to 1**, where:\n",
    "       - **1** indicates a perfect fit, meaning the model explains all the variability in the target variable.\n",
    "       - **0** means the model does not explain any of the variability.\n",

    "- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**\n",
    "  - MSE helps quantify the **average error magnitude** between the actual and predicted values.\n",
    "  - **Lower MSE** values indicate that the model's predictions are more accurate, while **higher MSE** values suggest larger errors.\n",

    "  - A **higher R² value** (close to 1) means that the model fits the data well and explains most of the variability.\n",
    "  - A **lower R² value** (close to 0) means that the model does not explain the variability in the data well, suggesting that a different approach or more features may be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why These Metrics Are Important\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MSE and R² are standard evaluation metrics** in regression analysis, helping us understand the accuracy and goodness-of-fit of the model.\n",
