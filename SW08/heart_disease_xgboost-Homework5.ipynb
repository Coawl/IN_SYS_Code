    "**XGBoost** natively supports continuous data, like resting blood pressure (**restbp**) and maximum heart rate (**thalach**), it does not natively support categorical data, like chest pain (**cp**), which contains 4 different categories. Thus, in order to use categorical data with **XGBoost**, we have to use a trick that converts a column of categorical data into multiple columns of binary values. This trick is called **One-Hot Encoding**.\n",

    "2. atypical angina\n",
    "3. non-anginal pain\n",
    "4. asymptomatic\n",
    "\n",
    "If we treated these values, 1, 2, 3 and 4, like continuous data, then we would assume that 4, which means \"asymptomatic\", is more similar to 3, which means \"non-anginal pain\", than it is to 1 or 2, which are other types of chest pain. That means the **XGBoost Tree** would be more likely to cluster the patients with 4s and 3s together than the patients with 4s and 1s together. In contrast, if we treat these numbers like categorical data, then we treat each one a separate category that is no more or less similar to any of the other categories. Thus, the likelihood of clustering patients with 4s with 3s is the same as clustering 4s with 1s, and that approach is more reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
